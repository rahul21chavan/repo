## **Project Status Overview**

### **1. Core Parsing & Chunking Engine**
- Implemented a robust parser that accurately splits PL/SQL scripts into logical, top-level blocks (procedures, functions, etc.), handling nested `BEGIN...END` constructs and Oracle's `/` delimiter.
- Chunking is performed exactly once per code input/upload, ensuring stability and preventing accidental reprocessing.
- Each chunk is classified (e.g., PROCEDURE, FUNCTION, ANONYMOUS_BLOCK), with metadata including serial number, block type, line count, and unique block ID.

### **2. User Interface (UI)**
- Developed an intuitive Streamlit-based UI.
- Supports both file upload and direct code paste.
- Provides a detailed, auditable table view of all PL/SQL chunks and their metadata.
- Conversion to PySpark occurs **only** upon explicit user action, ensuring clarity and intentionality in workflow.

### **3. PL/SQL to PySpark Conversion**
- Integrated with Gemini and Azure OpenAI LLMs for automated code translation.
- Each chunk is converted and statically validated for PySpark best practices (checks for SparkSession, DataFrame API usage, etc.).
- Conversion results and validation feedback are shown side-by-side for each block.

### **4. Audit & Export Capabilities**
- All mappings of PL/SQL to PySpark, along with full chunk metadata, can be exported as CSV for audit and compliance needs.
- Users can optionally generate a unified, optimized PySpark script for the entire PL/SQL input.

## **Key Achievements**
- **Stability:** One-time chunking per input ensures consistent mapping and traceability.
- **Auditability:** Every block is uniquely identified and classified; full data is available for downstream analysis.
- **User-Driven Workflow:** Conversion and further processing are performed only on user request, preventing accidental or recursive runs.
- **Quality Assurance:** Static validation of PySpark output helps ensure code quality before adoption.

## **Risks & Mitigations**
- **LLM API Limits:** Addressed via chunking logic and static validation.
- **PL/SQL Edge Cases:** Monitoring and logging for continuous parser improvement.
- **User Errors:** The UI workflow reduces risk of accidental reprocessing or data loss.

## **Summary**
The tool is stable, traceable, and user-friendly, providing end-to-end support for PL/SQL to PySpark migration with strong audit and compliance features. The core workflow is complete and ready for broader testing and potential pilot deployments. Ongoing work will further strengthen robustness and enterprise readiness.
