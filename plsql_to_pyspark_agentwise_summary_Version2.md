## **Agent-wise Progress Summary**

### 1. **Parsing & Chunking Agent**
- Accurately parses PL/SQL scripts, removes comments, and splits code into logical blocks (procedures, functions, anonymous blocks) by tracking nesting (`BEGIN...END`) and delimiters.
- Ensures each chunk is stable, valid, and uniquely identified for traceability.

### 2. **Classification Agent**
- Analyzes each code chunk to determine its type (e.g., PROCEDURE, FUNCTION, PACKAGE, ANONYMOUS_BLOCK).
- Provides structured metadata critical for mapping, audit, and downstream processing.

### 3. **User Interface (UI) Agent**
- Offers a user-friendly Streamlit interface for uploading files, pasting code, and reviewing parsed blocks.
- Displays detailed chunk metadata and allows users to trigger conversions and download results.

### 4. **LLM Conversion Agent**
- Integrates with Gemini and Azure OpenAI for translating each PL/SQL chunk (or entire script) into PySpark using the DataFrame API.
- Ensures each conversion is traceable and mapped 1:1 with the original PL/SQL block.

### 5. **Validation Agent**
- Runs static checks on generated PySpark code to detect missing imports, improper Spark usage, or anti-patterns.
- Prepends validation feedback to each output for transparency and improvement.

### 6. **Audit & Export Agent**
- Compiles all original and converted code, plus metadata, into a downloadable CSV for audit and compliance.
- Supports export of the final, optimized PySpark script for enterprise use.

## **Next Steps**
- Expand support for additional and more complex PL/SQL constructs in parsing and classification.
- Enhance validation logic to cover more PySpark best practices and real-world anti-patterns.
- Improve performance for very large scripts and further optimize UI responsiveness.
- Prepare for pilot user feedback and production deployment, including more robust error handling and logging.
