## **Project Status Overview**

### **1. Core Parsing & Chunking Agent**
- **Comment Removal Agent:**  
  Strips both single-line (`-- ...`) and multi-line (`/* ... */`) comments from PL/SQL code to ensure clean parsing and prevent false delimiters or keywords inside comments from breaking logic.

- **Top-Level Split Agent:**  
  Parses the PL/SQL script line by line, splitting into logical blocks using the `/` delimiter, but only at the outermost level (when not nested within a `BEGIN...END` block). Maintains nesting depth tracking to avoid erroneous splits inside nested blocks.

- **Safe Sub-Chunking Agent:**  
  For large blocks exceeding a set line threshold, further splits at safe boundaries—only where not in a nested block and preferably on statement ends. This produces manageable, logically valid code chunks ready for LLM processing.

- **Block Classification Agent:**  
  Each chunk/block is classified by type (PROCEDURE, FUNCTION, PACKAGE, ANONYMOUS_BLOCK, etc.) using pattern matching on headers. This supports traceability, audit, and informed conversion logic.

- **Chunk Metadata Agent:**  
  Every chunk is assigned a serial number, unique chunk ID, block type, and line count. These metadata fields are used throughout the workflow and in all exports for compliance and audit.

### **2. User Interface (UI) Agent**
- Developed a modern, intuitive Streamlit-based UI with custom styling and user profile display.
- Supports both file upload and direct code paste input methods.
- Presents a detailed, auditable table view of all PL/SQL code chunks and their metadata, allowing users to review the chunking before conversion.

---

### **3. Conversion Agent**
- **LLM Provider Agent:**  
  Integrates both Gemini and Azure OpenAI models for automated PL/SQL-to-PySpark conversion. Abstraction allows for easy switching or expansion to new providers.
- **User-Driven Conversion Agent:**  
  Conversion of PL/SQL blocks to PySpark is performed only when users explicitly trigger the action, preventing unnecessary or recursive computation.
- **Conversion Mapping Agent:**  
  Each chunk is converted independently and results are mapped 1:1 with the original PL/SQL blocks, preserving chunk IDs and metadata for traceability.

---

### **4. Validation Agent**
- **PySpark Static Validation Agent:**  
  After conversion, each PySpark block is validated for best practices and common errors—checking for SparkSession usage, DataFrame API patterns, proper imports, and avoiding anti-patterns (e.g., RDD usage).
- **Validation Feedback Agent:**  
  Validation comments and status are prepended to the converted code and presented to the user for transparency and further review.

---

### **5. Audit & Export Agent**
- **Audit Mapping Agent:**  
  All mappings from PL/SQL to PySpark, along with chunk metadata, are compiled into a DataFrame for review within the UI.
- **CSV Export Agent:**  
  Users can export the entire mapping (including serial number, chunk ID, block type, original block, and converted code) as a CSV for downstream audit, compliance, and documentation needs.
- **Optimized PySpark Output Agent:**  
  Optionally, users can trigger an LLM-powered optimized conversion for the entire PL/SQL script, generating a single, production-ready PySpark file.

---

## **Key Achievements**
- **Stability:** One-time chunking and user-driven conversion ensure consistent, traceable results.
- **Auditability:** Rich metadata and explicit mapping support compliance and review.
- **Quality Assurance:** Static validation of generated PySpark code before adoption.
- **Extensibility:** Agent-based modular design allows for easy expansion and adaptation.

---

## **Risks & Mitigations**
- **LLM API Limits:** Addressed via robust chunking and validation logic.
- **PL/SQL Edge Cases:** Continuous monitoring and logging for parser and agent improvements.
- **User Errors:** Stepwise UI reduces risk of accidental reprocessing or data loss.

---

## **Summary**
All agent components are integrated and operational, providing a stable, auditable, and user-friendly workflow for PL/SQL to PySpark migration. The tool is ready for extended testing and pilot deployments, with a strong foundation for further enhancement and enterprise adoption.
